        <ul><em>"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand"</em><br>
        <li> <strong>Look</strong></li>
        Keep your eyes <em>focus</em> on what are people doing.
        
            <li><strong>Listen</strong></li>
        Keep your mouth in <em>silent mode.</em> Don't make any noise and distrub them. 
        
            <li><strong>Read</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Ask</strong></li>
        <em>Accumulate learning by study, understand what you learn by questioning.</em> Be Brave to ask anything what you don't know yet or  what are made you confused.
        
            <li><strong>Try again</strong> </li>
        Don't give up easyly, we should keep in try and learning. Anthony J. D'Angelo said in The College Blue Book <em>"Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow"</em>
